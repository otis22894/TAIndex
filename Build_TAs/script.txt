What’s really cool about Specialty Froths is that they make beers with flavored froths—honey or chocolate or fruit or what have you. Anyway it’s a major hit. The company’s owned by a partnership of three guys: Luke, Max, and Bill. Luke owns the business, Max is in charge of making the beer, and Bill is the froth guy—he invents new flavors and tries them out and stuff. Well, anyway, Max gets greedy and decides he wants a ½ share of the business. He thinks Bill’s job isn’t as hard as everyone makes it out to be. So, he spends six months watching Bill, trying to learn as much as he can about the process of frothing. After that time, he decides that yeah, he could do it too. So one day, when he thinks he’s got it all settled, he comes into work with a shotgun and shoots Bill dead in cold blood. The ruckus brings in Luke, who, seeing the dead body on the floor, screams, “You killed my frother!” “No Luke. I am your frother.”']]]);
